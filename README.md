# stock-inquiry-chatbot
In this project, you can chat with the bot and search stock prices on WeChat. 

The stock search part uses the iexfinance module to search the current price, open price, close price and volume of each company. There will be more stock search functions in the future. 

With the module wxpy, you can use WeChat as the platform to chat or search the stocks. 

With rasa_nlu, it can learn from the training data and extract entities. The bot will know your intent from these entities. 

Finally, I want to express my gratitude to Professor Fan Zhang who gave us lectures about natural languange processing.
